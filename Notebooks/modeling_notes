Summary:
The modeled price for Big Mountain Resort is $95.87, with an actual price of $81.00. This suggests there is some room to increase the current ticket price, given the current feature set of the resort. It may be useful to introduce the higher price along with increasing communication regarding the features of the resort. Even a modest increase of $5.00 per ticket grosses $8,750,000, given 350,000 visitors skiing for 5 days on average. The small increase in ticket price is likely to offset increased operational costs of the recently added lift, and a further price raise may be absorbable given the plethora of quality resort features. If additonal cost reduction is desired, it is recommended to eliminate one run. If more than one run is closed down, it is recommended to reduce costs further by closing up to 5. However, it must be noted that revenue is predicted to drop precipitously if over 5 runs are shut down. Conclusion: Big Mountain Resort has a lot of features that predict a substantially higher ticket price, however it must be taken into consideration that BMR has the highest ticket price in Montana. 

Further work:
The current model does not consider several data. There may be useful data if a region feature is added (ie. North East, Midwest, etc). A distance to other resorts and population centers, in addition to state level statistics, may also be useful. Additionally, regional incomes have not been considered in the current model. When modeling future decisions it may be useful to consider both capital expense and operational costs as additional features, although market comparisons may be hard to validate. For ongoing exploration, a quick web app could be built using the 8 most important features, as independent variables, as inputs.
