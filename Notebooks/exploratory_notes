The data set consists of multiple features including some of the following: name, region, number of lifts, ski area size, elevation, days open, and price. Since this data set is said to represent comparable resorts, the state feature in itself is not very informative. The state feature engineered to various ratios, may be a useful feature. However state itself, along with region and name, is to be dropped for modeling. Additionally, there may be an opportunity to segment regionally, or to add a distance feature. The target AdultWeekend was chosen since it has the most complete data.
